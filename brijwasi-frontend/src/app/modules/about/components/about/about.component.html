      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2020, Brijwasi Delight started with a simple mission: to deliver authentic Indian cuisine
        with the same love and care that goes into home cooking. What began as a small kitchen has grown into
        a trusted food delivery platform serving thousands of satisfied customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that great food brings people together. Every dish we prepare is crafted with traditional
        recipes passed down through generations, using only the freshest and finest ingredients.
